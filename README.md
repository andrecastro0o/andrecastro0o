Ol√°! My name is Andr√© Castro (he/him). I am a software practitioner
working within knowledge and data management, for scientific research.

I am a senior developer and lead of the Integration Systems Team, at [Digital Archiving and Networking Service (DANS)](https://dans.knaw.nl/)

Between 2022 and 2024 I worked as data manager for the large scale research infrastructure [*Ruisdael
Observatory*](https://ruisdael-observatory.nl/), at TU-Delft. 

From 2020 to 2022 I took on the role of knowledge engineer at the German
National Library of Science and Technology, in the domains of chemistry
([*NFDI4Chem*](https://www.nfdi4chem.de/)), and cultural heritage
([*NFDI4Culture*](https://nfdi4culture.de/index.html)).

I tutored at the [*Experimental
Publishing*](https://xpub.nl/) program at the Piet Zwart Art Institute, Between 2013 and 2020.
I tought prototyping classes (focused on python and Linux-based
systems), and coached students through their graduation projects.

In 2013 I graduated from the Master of Media Design and Communication at
the Piet Zwart Institute, and in 2007, from the Sonic Arts BA program at
Middlesex University.
